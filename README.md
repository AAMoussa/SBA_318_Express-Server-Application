made a directory for this project and cd'd in in it,
named it "express-server-app". used 'git init' to initialize it
as a git repository, then initialize it with npm 'init -y' to access Node.js.
I also installed all the necessary dependencies for this project and most
importantly is express package using 'npm install express ejs body-parser'.
